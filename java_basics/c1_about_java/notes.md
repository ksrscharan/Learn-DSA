# Why JAVA?
- Java is popular language.
- fast, reliable, secure.
- based on c++. 
- platform independent language.
- object oriented programming language.
- robust.
- Multithreaded.
- compiled.
- doesn't require preprocessor.

# Sample Syntax
- For some editors, class name shoulf match filename
- File name and type should be in this fashion
    - XXXX.java
-


    public class XXXX{
        public static void main(String args[]){
            System.out.println("Hello");
        }
    }

## Output
    Hello

## Let's understand code 
    public class XXXX{
> class: this is a keyword used to define a class.

        public static void main(String args[]){
> public: keyword that gives access to JVM to run this method from anywhere

> static: When java runtime starts, there is no object of the class present. Thatâ€™s why the main method has to be static so that JVM can load the class into memory and call the main method.

> void: states that this method isn't returning anything.

> main: name of the method. main method is the only method that java searches for when you run.

# Variables

- variable is name of reserved area allocated in memory.
- value of variable can change
- when we define a variable, a small block of memory is alloted to store any value it can have.
<!--  -->

    datatype variableName = value;
<!--  -->
- There are many datatypes to store different types of values.

# Data Types
- There are 2 types of data types
    - primitive data types
    - non primitive data types

## Primitive Datatypes
- there are 8 primitive data types.
    - boolean
        > stores boolean value [ true ] [ false ]
        - storage: 1 bit
    - char
        > stores character unicode value [ 'c' ] [ '9' ] [ ' ' ]
        - storage: 16-bit Unicode Character
    - byte
        > number from -128 to 127
        - storage: 8-bit or 1 byte
    - short
        > numbers from -32768 to 32767
        - storage: 16-bit or 2 bytes
    - int
        > numbers from -2^31 to 2^31 - 1
        - storage: 32-bit or 4 bytes
    - long
        > numbers from -2^63 to 2^63 - 1
        - storage: 64-bit or 8 bytes
    - float
        > stores decimal values
        - storage: 32-bit or 4 byte
    - double
        > stores multiple decimal values
        - storage: 64-bit or 8 bytes

## Non Primitive Data Types
- typically some object like stuff.
- stores reference to an object in memory.
    - String
<!--  -->

# Operators
- used to perform operations.
- there are many types of operators.
    - unary operator
    - arithmetic operator
    - shift operator
    - relational operator
    - bitwise operator
    - logical operator
    - ternary operator
    - assignment operator

## Unary operator
- x++
- x--
- ++x, --x
- ! , ~
## Arithmetic Operator
- *, /, +, -, %
## Shift operator
- >>, <<, >>>
## relational operator
- >, <, <=, >=
- ==, !=
## bitwise operators
- & , | , ^
## logical operator
- && , ||
## ternary operator
- condition ? work1 : work 2
<!--  -->

> relational, logical operators when used return boolean values
